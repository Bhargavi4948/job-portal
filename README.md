The Job Portal Application is a Node.js-based project that allows companies to register, post jobs, and send job alerts to candidates. It uses Express.js for the server, MongoDB for data storage, and Nodemailer for email functionality. To run the project locally, you need to have Node.js and MongoDB installed. Start by cloning the repository, navigating to the project directory, and installing dependencies using `npm install`. Create a `.env` file with `MONGO_URI`, `EMAIL`, and `EMAIL_PASS` variables, and replace them with your MongoDB connection string and email credentials. Start the MongoDB server, then run the application using `npm start`. Access the endpoints like `/api/auth/register` for registering companies, `/api/auth/login` for login, and `/api/jobs/post` to post jobs. You can also add candidates to jobs and send alerts using `/api/jobs/add-candidate`. Ensure MongoDB is running and your `.env` file is correctly set up.
